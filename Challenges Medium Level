Problem:
Julia asked her students to create some coding challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and the total number of challenges created by each student.
Sort your results by the total number of challenges in descending order. If more than one student created the same number of challenges, then sort the result by hacker_id.
If more than one student created the same number of challenges and the count is less than the maximum number of challenges created, then exclude those students from the result.

Solution:
SELECT C.hacker_id, H.name, COUNT(C.challenge_id) AS Total_Challenges
FROM Hackers AS H JOIN Challenges AS C ON C.hacker_id = H.hacker_id
GROUP BY C.hacker_id, H.name
HAVING COUNT(C.challenge_id) = (SELECT TOP 1 COUNT(C1.challenge_id) FROM Challenges AS C1 GROUP BY C1.hacker_id ORDER BY COUNT(C1.challenge_id) DESC)
            OR COUNT(C.challenge_id) NOT IN (SELECT COUNT(C2.challenge_id)
                                       FROM Challenges C2
                                       WHERE C2.hacker_id <> C.hacker_id
                                       GROUP BY C2.hacker_id
                                      )
ORDER BY Total_Challenges DESC, C.hacker_id;
